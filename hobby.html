    <i>Music</i>
  </h2>
  <p>Music has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. I first started singing in church when I was little but have since moved on to singing in choir, musicals, bands, acapella groups, and more. I am also an avid listener of all kinds of music. My current obsession is the Beach Boys' "Pet Sounds"</p>
