      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>This is "Their Thought." We are here to share and discuss our thoughts on different media that we feel like discussing. We were founded on the idea that it's always cool to hear multiple opinions, so our reviewers all review the same things, so that the reader is able to get a more well formed opinion. We will occasionally get together to discuss things with each other or make collaborative things such as lists. However, most of the time, reviews that you read will be completely independent from each other.</p>
